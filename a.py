# This is a simple script that prints "sa" indefinitely.
# It defines a main function that contains an infinite loop.
# When the script is run directly, it calls the main function.
# The script uses the standard Python idiom to check if it is being run as the main module.
# The infinite loop will continue until the program is manually terminated.
